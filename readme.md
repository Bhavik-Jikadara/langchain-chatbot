## Brief explanation of how RAG works

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot augments the knowledge of an LLM with additional information provided in the prompt. The process involves vectorizing the text for augmented knowledge, finding the most similar text to the prompt, and passing this text to the LLM as a prefix.
